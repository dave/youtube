# Wilderness Prime YouTube Uploader

This tool uploads videos to YouTube:

- Titles and descriptions are generated by data and Go templates in a Google Sheet.
- Videos are uploaded from a Google Drive folder.
- Changes can be previewed before uploading, with diffs shown in the Google Sheet.
- Thumbnails are generated automatically.
- Uploads are resumed if the tool is interrupted.

I use this tool to upload all videos to the [Wilderness Prime YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/wildernessprime). 

*This tool is not intended for general use.*

# Google Sheet containing data and templates

# Oracle VM

Oracle gives out free VMs, so that's what I've been using to run the tool. 

[This is how to configure it](oracle.md)

## Oracle VM notes

```ssh -i ~/.ssh/oracle-ssh-key.key ubuntu@132.226.215.4```

- **New tmux session**: `tmux new -s mysession`
- **Detach**: `Ctrl + B`, then `D`
- **Reconnect** later: `tmux attach -t mysession`

# Keys

This tool uses three keys, which you will need to copy into `~/.config/wildernessprime/`.

## google-service-account-token.json
This is the service account key for authenticating with Google Sheets and Google Drive.

Create here: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/details/104677990570467761179/keys?inv=1&invt=AbqgZw&project=wildernessprime&supportedpurview=project

## youtube-oauth2-client-secret.json
This is the OAuth2 client secret for authenticating with YouTube.

Create here: https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/clients?inv=1&invt=AbqgZQ&project=wildernessprime

Refresh token `youtube-oauth2-refresh-token.json` is created automatically by the oauth login script the first time it runs.

## dropbox-oauth-access-token.txt
This is the Dropbox access token for authenticating with Dropbox. To authenticate, you need to create a Dropbox app and generate an access token:

https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create

Add permissions:
- files.metadata.write
- files.metadata.read
- files.content.write
- files.content.read
- sharing.read

Click "Generate" under "Generated access token" to create the access token.
